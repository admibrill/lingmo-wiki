## What is the password for Lingmo Live User during the installation process?
`live`. If there are any changes, they will be explained here.

## What Linux distribution does Lingmo OS based on?
[Debian](https://debian.org).

## Why not Debian 12 (stable) but Debian 13 (unstable)?
We planned to migrate LingmoDE to Qt6, since Debian 12 don't have necessary packages, we have to use Debian 13.

## Why not Arch?
There's a project called ArchLingmo before(see [glossary](glossary#archlingmo)), but it was cancelled because we have found that Debian is easier for beginners(on system maintenance tasks).

However, LingmoDE packages are still available on AUR.

# Are there any LingmoDE packages for Debian 12?
Yes. See <https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/elysia:/LingmoOS/Debian_12/>.

    1. In `System settings -> Window management -> Window rules -> Appearance & Fixes`:  
       - Add `[steam]` and set `No titlebar` and frame to `No`.  
    2. In `System settings -> Application Style -> Window decoration -> Breeze theme setting -> Window specific overrides`:  
       - Add `[steam]` and set `Hide Window title bar` to `Yes`.  

- **Add Debug Messages:**  
    For troubleshooting, enable debug logs during build:  

    ```bash  
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug  
    cmake --build . -j  
    ```  

    View debug messages with:  

    ```bash  
    journalctl -f | grep kwin  
    ```  

    Or use colorful logs:  

    ```bash

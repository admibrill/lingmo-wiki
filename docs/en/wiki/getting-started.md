## About Lingmo OS
> [Lingmo OS Official Website](https://lingmo.org/)

Fast, free and full of new features. The latest release of Lingmo OS delivers new tools and enhancements for developers, creators, gamers and administrators.

Lingmo GNU/Linux (Lingmo OS) is a operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux. It offers a beautiful Desktop environment, includes software tailored for this environment, and features a unified UI style. Lingmo OS aims to provide a smooth and visually appealing desktop experience.

### UI and New Desktop Environment
Lingmo OS adopts a new design different from traditional KDE, making operations less cumbersome. We have also optimized and refactored CutefishDE to make the operation more user-friendly, enhancing the interaction and visual experience.

### Lightweight and Smooth Experience
Lingmo OS can run on low-performance hardware, offering a lighter and smoother experience than heavy desktop operating systems like Windows 11. Its lightweight nature ensures a fast and enjoyable user experience, making it an ideal choice for both newcomers and seasoned Linux enthusiasts.
